# Hackathon II – Phase I  
## Spec-Driven Todo CLI Application (In-Memory)

This repository contains **Phase I** of **Hackathon II: Spec-Driven Development – The Evolution of Todo**.  
The goal of this phase is to demonstrate **strict Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** by building a **Python-based Todo CLI application** using **Claude Code and Spec-Kit Plus**, without writing manual code.

---

## 📌 Phase Overview

**Phase I Objective:**  
Build a command-line Todo application that stores tasks **in memory**, implements all **basic Todo features**, and is developed **entirely through specifications**.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Spec-Driven Development (no manual coding)
- Clean project structure
- Iterative refinement of specs until correct behavior is achieved

---

## ✅ Implemented Features

The application supports all **Basic Level Todo features**:

- ➕ **Add Task** – Create a task with title and description  
- 📋 **View Tasks** – List all tasks with status indicators  
- ✏️ **Update Task** – Modify task title or description  
- ❌ **Delete Task** – Remove a task by ID  
- ✔️ **Mark Complete / Incomplete** – Toggle task status  

All data is stored **in memory** (no database), as required for Phase I.

## 🧠 Development Methodology

This project strictly follows **Spec-Driven Development**:

1. Write feature specifications in Markdown  
2. Refine specifications until unambiguous  
3. Use **Claude Code** to generate the implementation  
4. If behavior is incorrect, **update the spec instead of editing code**  

🚫 **No code was written manually**
